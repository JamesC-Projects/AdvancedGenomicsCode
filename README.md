# AdvancedGenomicsCode
This will contain the code and crucial datasets needed to replicate the analyses performed in Advanced Genomics

This assignment aims to take data from EBI project (Study: ERP005558) and perform quality control, followed by Kraken 2
paired-read alignments to the 8gb standard database. This will produce output files showing species identified in the samples
as determined by the Kraken2 standard database, with Bracken used to calculate the abundance of different species in the samples and
LefSe used to calculate statistically significant species expression between samples.
